                <p>
                    You've told me that the only thing that is stopping us is the timing. Looking back at 2016, You friendzoned me because the distance was too great for us to work. We were different people that has similar interests. Talking to you felt easy, like I've already known you for a long time. Throughout the years, we've kept in touch as friends, you became my diary, I can confidently say that you know me better than anyone else even if you already forgot about the details of our conversations.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I'm glad for every time skip we had because it allowed us to reconnect and see how much we've grown. It feels like we both witnessed each other's growth. I do think that you have outgrown me in some aspects, and I am proud of you for that. You have become a strong, independent person. I know that you can achieve anything you set your mind to. You are stronger than me in so many ways, and I admire that about you.
                </p>

                <p>
                   I made this website to serve as an archive of our shared memories. Although it needs some polishing, I hope you like it and see this as yours as much as it is mine. There are a lot of gaps in our story, and I want to fill them in the coming years. For now, I wish you a happy Valentine's Day and a wonderful healing journey. I want you to know that im not going anywhere so just do your thing.
                </p>

                <p>P.S dont get triggered u beautiful little avoidant woman.</p>
